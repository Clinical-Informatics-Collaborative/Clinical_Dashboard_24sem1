# STEP 2: Connect Redcap to R through API

Please refer to the `.docx` for step by step guide.

_Note: Directly connecting through API is not recommend because it may takes too long to get the data. A 5000 patient Redcap project can take up to 2 minutes. Therefore building an external intermediary database is recommended. See the next step for detail._
